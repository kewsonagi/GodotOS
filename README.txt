Move the panel on the left wherever you want.
Configure where your code snippets are loaded from and stored. Can be both within the project and somewhere else.
Click on a snippet to preview and copy. The ">" pops it into the edit.
On the top right you find a "SNIP" button, this will display your copied code. Make changes and choose a place/name to save!

Feel free to send suggestions to my twitter @itsben321 :)
